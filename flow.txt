1) outside config contain the information
2) Inside config will combine the entity(structure) and the input or information(provided by outside configfile )

3) this reading yaml file will be stored in the util folder , this util folder is not  a part of the pipeline 
    this is just create to do a generic function such as reading the yaml file, reading a pickle object

Ques1)) what is conguration and artifact?????

configuration file is created to only provide input to the components  while artifact folder we have 
to create to store the output of each component

In the entity folder itself we have to create 2 files [configuration and artifact]  because artifact is also a entity
